This directory contains shader inputs that were assembled into glsl
shaders to be served by tiltbrush.com and referenced by exported
glTF geometry.

To make shader changes:

  Modify and/or create a file in Generators/ then use menu item
    Tilt -> glTF -> Sync Export Materials...
  This will preprocess and generate files into Support/TiltBrush.com/shaders. These files will not
  appear in "git status" because they are git ignored

  Alternatively, you can directly edit files in TiltBrush.com/shaders, but
  your edits will be overwritten the next time you generate them.

To preview shader changes locally:

  - Set up a minimal THREE.js viewer
  - Set "Copy Assets To Gltf" in App.Config; this will create fully-self-contained
    gltf exports
  - Run Tilt Brush, load file, run Tilt -> glTF -> Export to glTF
  - Load up your .gltf in your local viewer

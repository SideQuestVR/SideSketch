To build the TiltBrushCpp.dll:

  * Open the tiltBrushCpp.sln project in Visual Studio 2013.
  * BUILD > Build Solution.

To install the DLL:

  * Close down Unity (because Unity sometimes locks the file).
  * Delete Assets/TiltBrushCpp/Windows/TiltBrushCpp.dll.
  * Copy Support/TiltBrushCpp/x86/Release/TiltBrushCpp to Assets/TiltBrushCpp/Windows.
